        <h1>Why Modern Man Must Not Commit Suicide: A Rejection of God</h1>
        <p>Modern man stands at a crossroads: either he clings to the dead weight of religion, hoping for salvation in an afterlife that will never come, or he faces the raw, indifferent universe and creates meaning for himself. The weak turn to God to soothe their fears, to justify their suffering, to provide an easy answer where none exists. But this is a lie, a coward’s escape from reality...</p>
        <p>Religion, in its essence, is a doctrine of weakness. It tells man that his suffering has a purpose, that his struggles are mere tests for a better world beyond this one. This is nothing but a poison that breeds passivity and submission...</p>
        <p>But what of meaning? Does atheism not leave man lost, adrift in an absurd universe? Camus answers this challenge: yes, life is absurd, but this is not cause for despair. It is cause for rebellion...</p>
        <p>Dostoevsky, though he feared this conclusion, understood the stakes of a godless world. His character Kirillov, in Demons, grasps the truth that without God, man is free but he mistakenly believes that absolute freedom must end in self-destruction...</p>
        <p>Thus, modern man must not commit suicide, for in doing so, he would only fulfill the worst instincts of religion: the desire to escape, to submit, to refuse responsibility for his own existence...</p>
