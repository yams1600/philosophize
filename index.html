        <h1>Why Modern Man Must Not Commit Suicide: A Rejection of God</h1>
        <p>Modern man stands at a crossroads: either he clings to the dead weight of religion, hoping for salvation in an afterlife that will never come, or he faces the raw, indifferent universe and creates meaning for himself. The weak turn to God to soothe their fears, to justify their suffering, to provide an easy answer where none exists. But this is a lie, a coward’s escape from reality. Nietzsche, Camus, and even Dostoevsky despite his struggle recognized that if God is dead, man must not collapse in despair. Instead of seeking refuge in illusion or self-destruction, he must embrace life as an act of defiance. Suicide is not an answer it is the final, pathetic retreat of those unwilling to accept the truth: that life has no given meaning, and that this is what makes it worth living..</p>
        <p>Religion, in its essence, is a doctrine of weakness. It tells man that his suffering has a purpose, that his struggles are mere tests for a better world beyond this one. This is nothing but a poison that breeds passivity and submission. Nietzsche saw this clearly in Christianity, which glorifies suffering and meekness, turning man into a broken creature who kneels before an illusion. If modern man wishes to live, he must tear off these chains. He must reject the false comfort of an afterlife and instead affirm life here and now, in all its chaos and difficulty. To choose suicide is merely the religious instinct in another form it is the wish to escape, to abandon the struggle, to surrender rather than conquer. The real solution is not to die but to create, to shape the world rather than flee from it..
.</p>
        <p>But what of meaning? Does atheism not leave man lost, adrift in an absurd universe? Camus answers this challenge: yes, life is absurd, but this is not cause for despair. It is cause for rebellion.  If existence has no higher purpose, then man is truly free free to create his own values, free to give meaning to his own suffering, free to live as he chooses without submission to any god or master. The one who sees this and still chooses life is stronger than any religious believer, for he does not rely on myths to justify his existence. Suicide is the ultimate failure to revolt it is an admission that one cannot bear freedom, that one would rather cease to exist than carry the burden of responsibility for one’s own meaning.
.</p>
        <p>Dostoevsky, though he feared this conclusion, understood the stakes of a godless world. His character Kirillov, in Demons, grasps the truth that without God, man is free but he mistakenly believes that absolute freedom must end in self-destruction. This is the error of those who misunderstand atheism: they assume that without divine purpose, life is worthless. But Nietzsche’s Übermensch proves otherwise. The highest form of man is not the one who seeks divine approval or annihilation but the one who transcends both. To live without gods, without illusions, without surrender this is the ultimate act of power. The suicide is not free; he is a slave to his own despair. The free man, the true atheist, looks into the abyss and laughs..</p>
        <p>Thus, modern man must not commit suicide, for in doing so, he would only fulfill the worst instincts of religion: the desire to escape, to submit, to refuse responsibility for his own existence. He must reject not only the gods of the past but also the longing for nothingness that arises in their absence. To live without a god is not to live without meaning—it is to become the creator of meaning. Let the weak perish if they must, but those who have the strength to will their own existence must embrace it fully, fiercely, without compromise. There is no afterlife, no divine justice, no final reward. There is only this life and it must be affirmed..</p>
